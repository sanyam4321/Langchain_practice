Beneath the sun on fields so wide,
Where dreams and destinies collide,
The bat meets ball, a sharp refrain,
A game of glory, grit, and grain.

The bowler strides with fire and pace,
A silent storm, a hunted chase.
The batter stands, calm-eyed and bold,
A tale of skill about to unfold.

The willow sings, the leather flies,
A six arcs high in summer skies.
Fielders dart with panther grace,
Chasing shadows in the race.

The stumps stand tall like guards of old,
In this arena green and gold.
Every run, a beat, a breath,
Each over flirting close with death.

From village green to Eden’s pride,
In whites or blue, we’re unified.
For cricket isn’t just a game—
It’s heart and hope, it’s fire and flame.

So let the anthem rise again,
Of sun and sweat, of joy and pain.
A test of time, of mind and might,
Where day meets dusk in fading light.
